                Potbelly Pig
            </h1>
            <p>
                A healthy potbellied pig can grow to weigh 80 – 180 pounds. Many pigs brought to Lollypop Farm are
                surrendered because they grew too big for the home they were living in.
                A healthy potbellied pig can live to be between 12 – 15 years old.

                Fun Facts
            </h1>
            <p>Pigs' skin lacks hair, so they are very sensitive to the sun. In the wild they wallow in the mud to stay
                cool and protect their skin.
                Pigs use their snout for rutting and foraging.
                Vietnamese pot-bellied's are a sub-species of the common pig, probably descended from a Chinese
                ancestor.
                Pigs have poor vision but excellent senses of smell and hearing.
                In the wild, they may form herds of considerable numbers, one herd keeping its distance from others.
                Herd members communicate with a variety of squeaks, grunts, gurgles and other sounds, including
                different sneezes.
                The origin of the piggy bank in American society probably dates back to ancient China. Emperor Huang-Ti
                invented the Chinese calendar in 2367 B.C. and gave each year an animal representative. The year of the
                pig represents prosperity.
